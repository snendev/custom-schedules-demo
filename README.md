# Custom Schedules Demo

This repository was created to showcase a demo of how to use a custom Schedule
type in Bevy 0.11. It relies on `bevy_xpbd_2d` (version 0.2), which can be
configured to run in a consumer-defined Schedule. This is ultimately useful for
specific applications like server-side physics processing, but otherwise is just
an interesting API to showcase.

Please see the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyzW8w-2s00) for
more.

Additionally, see the
[Bevy profiling guide](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/profiling.md)
to see how to generate the profiler video shown in the video.
